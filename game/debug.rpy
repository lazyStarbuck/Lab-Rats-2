## This file is used to house all of the functions and lables used to debug LR2.##
# CURRENT CONCLUSIONS: #
# 1) Time to create people is independent of the number of people involved.
#
#
#
#
#
#

## LEADS:##
# 1) Outfits that deep copy other outfits (and other improper uses of deepcopy) will end up duplicating the image set library for each clothing item (which should be a singleton). That makes character objects huge and the game slow.
# 2) Moving characters at the end of the day takes seconds for a large number of people.
# 3) Running hte move code involves a deep copy. Likely the issue.
#
#
#

## RESOLUTIONS: ##
# 1) Add a create_copy function to the outfit and clothign class that properly copy it without the use of deep copy.
# 2) Review all uses of deep copy and remove them if at all possible. Purge them, they are almost certainly not being used correctly.
